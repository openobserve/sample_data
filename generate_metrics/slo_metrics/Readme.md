# SLO Metrics Data Generator

This folder contains sample data generation scripts for synthetic SLO (Service Level Objective) metrics.  
These scripts can be used to produce realistic metric datasets for testing dashboards, alerting, or observability pipelines.

## 📄 About This Script

**`slo_metrics_data.json`** is generated by the `generate_slo_metrics_data.py` script.  
It creates mock disk utilization metrics for multiple hosts and mount points, sampled every 10 seconds over the past 5 minutes.

- **Hosts:** `db1`, `db2`  
- **Mounts:** `/`, `/data`  
- **Metric Name:** `disk_utilization`  
- **Metric Type:** `gauge`  
- **Timezone:** Timestamps are generated in IST (UTC+5:30) but saved as UTC-based epoch milliseconds.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The script generates timestamps in IST.
2. It converts timestamps to UTC milliseconds.
3. For every timestamp, host, and mount combination, it generates a realistic utilization value:
   - Around **85–95%** every 7th point (to simulate spikes)
   - Around **40–60%** otherwise

4. The output is saved as `slo_metrics_data.json`.

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python disk_utilization_datageneration.py.py
